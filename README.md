# Scale
## Game Off 2023 entry
### Description
Scale is a score based music video game created in less than one month as an entry to the GitHub Game Off 2023.

As a 2 player game, you compete online against an opponent to win the battle. As the music plays you must hit the correct notes at the correct timing for your character to eat and gain weight, the winner is the one who tips the scales the furthest in their favour.

Too far off the beat and you'll drop your snack and don't hit the wrong note or you might end up with a chip in your eye and unable to compete for a second or 2.
